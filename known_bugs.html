    <tr><td><b>Saving to a File</b></td><td>When running over the Internet (in other words, when not running from a local copy of the source files), it is not possible to save the current set of boards to a file.</td><td>Seems to require the installation of an SSL certificate.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Saving Iconized Group Edits</b></td><td>Saving after editing the contents of an existing iconized group does not work - any edits are not saved.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Remnants of Selection Rectangle Remain</b></td><td>Occassionally, after or while selecting a set of objects using the selection ractangle, remnants of the red selection rectangle will remain on the screen.</td><td>We believe this is fixed. <p>If this happens to you, please open a bug report and note as much about what you did prior to this happening as possible.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Move on Top Obscures earlier Move</b></td><td>Move on top of an existing node overwrites the earlier move box. Would be better to keep both move boxes.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Forall Side Nodes Display on Exists Side in Game Play Mode</b></td><td>Sometimes, when switching to game-play mode, some or all of the For All side nodes how up on the Exists side. This seems to happen most often when using the Chrome-based debug environment.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Boards are not displayed when switching to Game Play Mode</b></td><td>When switching to Game Play Mode no nodes are displayed.</td><td>This seems always to be associated with the inability to copy and paste JSON.</td></tr>
