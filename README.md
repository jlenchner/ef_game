A web application that lets a user create an Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game on a pair of graphs and then play the game. 
The user can ask the computer to play the role of the Spoiler, Duplicator, or both Spoiler and Duplicator. 

Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games capture the quantifier rank needed to express a property P in First Order Logic. 
If examples of structures, S_i and S'_i, can be found, with each S_i satisfying the property P, and each S'_i not satisfying the property P, such that Spoiler needs larger and larger numberf of rounds to win the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game on the pair (S_i, S'_i), then the property P is not expressible in First Order Logic. 
Many properties of graphs (e.g., connectivity, being a cycle, being a tree) can be shown to be inexpressible in First Order Logic using this method.
